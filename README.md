# Holmes

This project was written to be used to automatically register my little brothers to activities at Holmes Place.

It is a service that every few hours collects what activities are available, and which ones require registration,
and schedules a registration to them at the time their registration opens.

## Config

There's the `config.py` file.
There are various parameters to config there for your own running.

## How to run

In order to run you just need to run `scheduling.py` in the background.
I use an EC2 instance to run this :)
